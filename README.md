What is KBLAS
=============

KAUST BLAS (KBLAS) is a high performance CUDA library implementing a subset of BLAS as well as Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) routines on NVIDIA GPUs. Using recursive and batch algorithms, KBLAS maximizes the GPU bandwidth, reuses locally cached data and increases device occupancy. KBLAS supports operations for regular dense and hierarchical low-rank matrix workloads. KBLAS provides, therefore, the critical building blocks not only for the traditional high performance dense linear algebra libraries, but also for the emerging numerical libraries supporting hierarchical low-rank matrix computations. This is a major leap toward leveraging GPU hardware accelerators for high performance low-rank matrix approximations and computations, which currently drives the research agenda of the linear algebra scientific community.

KBLAS is written in CUDA C. It requires CUDA Toolkit for installation.

Installation
============

KBLAS installation requires a recent **make**.
To build KBLAS, please follow these instructions:

1.  Get KBLAS from git repository

        git clone git@github.com:ecrc/kblas-gpu

    or

        git clone https://github.com/ecrc/kblas-gpu

2.  Go into KBLAS folder

        cd kblas-gpu

3.  Edit file make.inc to:
    - Enable / disable KBLAS sub modules (_SUPPORT_BLAS2_, _SUPPORT_BLAS3_, _SUPPORT_BATCH_TR_, _SUPPORT_SVD_, _SUPPORT_TLR_).
    - Enable / disable usage of third party libraries (_USE_MKL_, _USE_MAGMA_) for performance comparisons.
    - Provide path for third party libraries if required (_CUB_DIR_, _MAGMA_ROOT_).
    - Specify CUDA architecture to compile for (_CUDA_ARCH_).

    or

    - Provide equivalent environment variables.

4.  Build KBLAS

        make


Testing
=======

The folder 'testing' includes a set of sample programs to illustrate the usage of each KBLAS routine, as well as to test the performance 
and accuracy of such routines against other vendor libraries.
